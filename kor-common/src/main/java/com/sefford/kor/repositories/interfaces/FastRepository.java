 * Fast Repository interface is intended for some Repositories to optionally provide an API to
 * save and retrieve elements from themselves in a secondary way.
 * <p/>
 * The objective of this API is to provide a different way of saving and retrieving the elements
 * without accessing the normal get and set methods in which the standard implementation of {@link TwoTierRepository TwoTierRepository}
 * saves and retrieves on several levels sequentially.
 * <p/>
 * This gives the developer the chance to perform a simple save or retrieval in a single level of the
 * repository hierarchy. This is intended to be used with fast-access repositories as memory ones.
